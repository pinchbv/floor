# Floor
**A supportive SQLite abstraction for your Flutter applications.**

This is the runtime dependency.

Run the generator with `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`.
To automatically run it, whenever a file changes, use `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch`.

---
*As this Flutter library is influenced by the [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) database abstraction layer
and given, that the database layer usually is the bottom layer of an application - Floor.*
