as abstract classes with method signatures and query statements. DAO classes can use inherited methods by implementing and extending classes while also using mixins. @dao abstract class PersonDao { @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person' ) Future < List < Person >> findAllPeople (); @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = :id' ) Stream < Person ?> findPersonById ( int id ); @insert Future < void > insertPerson ( Person person ); } Queries \u00b6 Method signatures turn into query methods by adding the @Query() annotation with the query in parenthesis to them. Be mindful about the correctness of your SQL statements as they are only partly validated while generating the code. These queries have to return either a Future or a Stream of an entity, Dart core type or void . Retrieval of Dart Core types such as String , double , int , double , Uint8List can be used if you want to get all records from a certain column or return COUNT records in the table. Returning Future<void> comes in handy whenever you want to delete the full content of a table, for instance. Some query method examples can be seen in the following. A function returning a single item will return null when no matching row is found. Thereby, the function is required to return a nullable type. For example Person? . This way, we leave the handling of an absent row up to you and don't attempt to guess intention. @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = :id' ) Future < Person ?> findPersonById ( int id ); @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = :id AND name = :name' ) Future < Person ?> findPersonByIdAndName ( int id , String name ); @Query ( 'SELECT COUNT(id) FROM Person' ) Future < int ?> getPeopleCount (); // fetch records count @Query ( 'SELECT name FROM Person' ) Future < List < String >> getAllPeopleNames (); // fetch all records from one column @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person' ) Future < List < Person >> findAllPeople (); // select multiple items @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person' ) Stream < List < Person >> findAllPeopleAsStream (); // stream return @Query ( 'DELETE FROM Person' ) Future < void > deleteAllPeople (); // query without returning an entity @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id IN (:ids)' ) Future < List < Person >> findPeopleWithIds ( List < int > ids ); // query with IN clause Query arguments, when using SQLite's LIKE operator, have to be supplied by the input of a method. It's not possible to define a pattern matching argument like %foo% in the query itself. // dao @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE name LIKE :name' ) Future < List < Person >> findPeopleWithNamesLike ( String name ); // usage final name = '%foo%' ; await dao . findPeopleWithNamesLike ( name ); Data Changes \u00b6 Use the @insert , @update and @delete annotations for inserting and changing persistent data. All these methods accept single or multiple entity instances. Insert \u00b6 @insert marks a method as an insertion method. When using the capitalized @Insert you can specify a conflict strategy. Else it just defaults to aborting the insert. These methods can return a Future of either void , int or List<int> . - void return nothing - int return primary key of inserted item - List<int> return primary keys of inserted items @Insert ( onConflict: OnConflictStrategy . rollback ) Future < void > insertPerson ( Person person ); @insert Future < List < int >> insertPeople ( List < Person > people ); Update \u00b6 @update marks a method as an update method. When using the capitalized @Update you can specify a conflict strategy. Else it just defaults to aborting the update. These methods can return a Future of either void or int . - void return nothing - int return number of changed rows @Update ( onConflict: OnConflictStrategy . replace ) Future < void > updatePerson ( Person person ); @update Future < int > updatePeople ( List < Person > people ); Delete \u00b6 @delete marks a method as a deletion method. These methods can return a Future of either void or int . - void return nothing - int return number of deleted rows @delete Future < void > deletePerson ( Person person ); @delete Future < int > deletePeople ( List < Person > people ); Streams \u00b6 As already mentioned, queries cannot only return values once when called but also continuous streams of query results. The returned streams keep you in sync with the changes happening in the database tables. This feature plays well with the StreamBuilder widget which accepts a stream of values and rebuilds itself whenever there is a new emission. These methods return broadcast streams and thus, can have multiple listeners. A function returning a stream of single items will emit null when no matching row is found. Thereby, it's necessary to make the function return a stream of a nullable type. For example Stream<Person?> . In case you're not interested in null s, you can simply use Stream.where((value) => value != null) to get rid of them. // definition @dao abstract class PersonDao { @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = :id' ) Stream < Person ?> findPersonByIdAsStream ( int id ); @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person' ) Stream < List < Person >> findAllPeopleAsStream (); } // usage StreamBuilder < List < Person >> ( stream: dao . findAllPeopleAsStream (), builder: ( BuildContext context , AsyncSnapshot < List < Person >> snapshot ) { // do something with the values here }, ); Attention Only methods annotated with @insert , @update and @delete trigger Stream emissions. Inserting data by using the @Query() annotation doesn't. It is now possible to return a Stream if the function queries a database view. But it will fire on any @update , @insert , @delete events in the whole database, which can get quite taxing on the runtime. Please add it only if you know what you are doing! This is mostly due to the complexity of detecting which entities are involved in a database view. Transactions \u00b6 Whenever you want to perform some operations in a transaction you have to add the @transaction annotation to the method. It's also required to add the async modifier. These methods have to return a Future . @transaction Future < void > replacePeople ( List < Person > people ) async { await deleteAllPeople (); await insertPeople ( people ); } Inheritance \u00b6 Data access object classes support inheritance as shown in the following. There is no limit to inheritance levels and thus, each abstract parent can have another abstract parent. Bear in mind that only abstract classes allow method signatures without an implementation body and thereby, make sure to position your to-be-inherited methods in an abstract class and extend this class with your DAO. @dao abstract class PersonDao extends AbstractDao < Person > { @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = :id' ) Future < Person ?> findPersonById ( int id ); } abstract class AbstractDao < T > { @insert Future < void > insertItem ( T item ); } // usage final person = Person ( 1 , 'Simon' ); await personDao . insertItem ( person ); final result = await personDao . findPersonById ( 1 );","title":"Data Access Objects"},{"location":"daos/#data-access-objects","text":"These components are responsible for managing access to the underlying SQLite database and are defined as abstract classes with method signatures and query statements.

These methods return broadcast streams and thus, can have multiple listeners. A function returning a stream of single items will emit null when no matching row is found. Thereby, it's necessary to make the function return a stream of a nullable type. For example Stream<Person?> . In case you're not interested in null s, you can simply use Stream.where((value) => value != null) to get rid of them. // definition @dao abstract class PersonDao { @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = :id' ) Stream < Person ?> findPersonByIdAsStream ( int id ); @Query ( 'SELECT * FROM Person' ) Stream < List < Person >> findAllPeopleAsStream (); } // usage StreamBuilder < List < Person >> ( stream: dao . findAllPeopleAsStream (), builder: ( BuildContext context , AsyncSnapshot < List < Person >> snapshot ) { // do something with the values here }, ); Attention Only methods annotated with @insert , @update and @delete trigger Stream emissions.

Floor automatically creates the mappings between the in-memory objects and database table rows. It's possible to supply custom metadata to Floor by adding optional values to the Entity annotation. It has the additional attribute of tableName which opens up the possibility to use a custom name for that specific entity instead of using the class name. foreignKeys allows adding foreign keys to the entity. More information on how to use these can be found in the Foreign Keys section. Indices are supported as well. They can be used by adding an Index to the indices value of the entity. For further information of these, please refer to the Indices section. @PrimaryKey marks property of a class as the primary key column. This property has to be of type int. The value can be automatically generated by SQLite when autoGenerate is enabled. For more information about primary keys and especially compound primary keys, refer to the Primary Keys section. @ColumnInfo enables custom mapping of single table columns. With the annotation it's possible to give columns a custom name. If you want a table's column to be nullable, mark the entity's field as nullable. More information can be found in the Null Safety section. Attention Floor automatically uses the first constructor defined in the entity class for creating in-memory objects from database rows. There needs to be a constructor. @Entity ( tableName: 'person' ) class Person { @PrimaryKey ( autoGenerate: true ) final int id ; @ColumnInfo ( name: 'custom_name' ) final String name ; Person ( this . id , this . name ); } Supported Types \u00b6 Floor entities can hold values of the following Dart types which map to their corresponding SQLite types and vice versa. int - INTEGER double - REAL String - TEXT bool - INTEGER (0 = false, 1 = true) Uint8List - BLOB enum - INTEGER (records by the index 0..n) In case you want to store sophisticated Dart objects that can be represented by one of the above types, take a look at Type Converters . Primary Keys \u00b6 Whenever a compound primary key is required (e.g. n-m relationships), the syntax for setting the keys differs from the previously mentioned way of setting primary keys. Instead of annotating a field with @PrimaryKey , the @Entity annotation's primaryKey attribute is used. It accepts a list of column names that make up the compound primary key. @Entity ( primaryKeys: [ 'id' , 'name' ]) class Person { final int id ; final String name ; Person ( this . id , this . name ); } Foreign Keys \u00b6 Add a list of ForeignKey s to the Entity annotation of the referencing entity. childColumns define the columns of the current entity, whereas parentColumns define the columns of the parent entity. Foreign key actions can get triggered after defining them for the onUpdate and onDelete properties. @Entity ( tableName: 'dog' , foreignKeys: [ ForeignKey ( childColumns: [ 'owner_id' ], parentColumns: [ 'id' ], entity: Person , ) ], ) class Dog { @PrimaryKey () final int id ; final String name ; @ColumnInfo ( name: 'owner_id' ) final int ownerId ; Dog ( this . id , this . name , this . ownerId ); } Indices \u00b6 Indices help speeding up query, join and grouping operations. For more information on SQLite indices please refer to the official documentation . To create an index with floor, add a list of indices to the @Entity annotation. The example below shows how to create an index on the custom_name column of the entity. The index, moreover, can be named by using its name attribute. To set an index to be unique, use the unique attribute. @Entity ( tableName: 'person' , indices: [ Index ( value: [ 'custom_name' ])]) class Person { @primaryKey final int id ; @ColumnInfo ( name: 'custom_name' ) final String name ; Person ( this . id , this . name ); } Ignoring Fields \u00b6 Getters, setters and all static fields of entities are ignored by default and thus excluded from the library's mapping. In case further fields should be ignored, the @ignore annotation should be used and applied as shown in the following snippet. class Person { @primaryKey final int id ; final String name ; @ignore String nickname ; // ignored by default String get combinedName => \" $ name ( $ nickname )\" ; Person ( this . id , this . name ); } Inheritance \u00b6 Just like Daos, entities (and database views) can inherit from a common base class and use their fields. The entity just has to extend the base class. This construct will be treated as if all the fields in the base class are part of the entity, meaning the database table will have all columns of the entity and the base class. The base class does not have to have a separate annotation for the class. Its fields can be annotated just like normal entity columns. Foreign keys and indices have to be declared in the entity and can't be defined in the base class. class BaseObject { @PrimaryKey () final int id ; @ColumnInfo ( name: 'create_time' ) final String createTime ; @ColumnInfo ( name: 'update_time' ) final String updateTime ; BaseObject ( this . id , this . updateTime , { String createTime , }) : this . createTime = createTime ??

Please use it with caution and file issues for problems you encounter. SQLite allows storing values of only a handful types. Whenever more complex Dart in-memory objects should be stored, there sometimes is the need for converting between Dart and SQLite compatible types. Dart's DateTime , for instance, provides an object-oriented API for handling time. Objects of this class can simply be represented as int values by mapping DateTime to its timestamp in milliseconds. Instead of manually mapping between these types repeatedly, when reading and writing, type converters can be used. It's sufficient to define the conversion from a database to an in-memory type and vice versa once, which then is reused automatically. The implementation and usage of the mentioned DateTime to int converter is described in the following. Create a converter class that implements the abstract TypeConverter and supply the in-memory object type and database type as parameterized types. This class inherits the decode() and encode() functions which define the conversion from one to the other type. class DateTimeConverter extends TypeConverter < DateTime , int > { @override DateTime decode ( int databaseValue ) { return DateTime . fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch ( databaseValue ); } @override int encode ( DateTime value ) { return value . millisecondsSinceEpoch ; } } Apply the created type converter to the database by using the @TypeConverters annotation and make sure to additionally import the file of your type converter here. Importing it in your database file is always necessary because the generated code will be part of your database file and this is the location where your type converters get instantiated. @TypeConverters ([ DateTimeConverter ]) @Database ( version: 1 , entities: [ Order ]) abstract class OrderDatabase extends FloorDatabase { OrderDao get orderDao ; } Use the non-default DateTime type in an entity. @entity class Order { @primaryKey final int id ; final DateTime date ; Order ( this . id , this . date ); } Type converters can be applied to databases DAOs entities/views entity/view fields DAO methods DAO method parameters The type converter is added to the scope of the element so if you put it on a class, all methods/fields in that class will be able to use the converter. The closest type converter wins! If you, for example, add a converter on the database level and another one on a DAO method parameter, which takes care of converting the same types, the one declared next to the DAO method parameter will be used.
