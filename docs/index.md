# Welcome to Floor

Floor provides a neat SQLite abstraction for your Flutter applications inspired by the [Room persistence library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room).
It comes with automatic mapping between in-memory objects and database rows while still offering full control of the database with the use of SQL.
As a consequence, it's necessary to have an understanding of SQL and SQLite in order to harvest Floor's full potential.

- typesafe
- reactive
- lightweight
- SQL centric
- no hidden magic
- no hidden costs
- iOS, Android, Linux, macOS, Windows

⚠️ The library is on its way to its first stable release and is open to contributions!
