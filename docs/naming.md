# Naming

The library's name derives from the following.
*Floor* as the *bottom layer* of a [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) which points to the analogy of the database layer being the bottom and foundation layer of most applications.
Where *fl* also gives a pointer that the library is used in the Flutter context.
